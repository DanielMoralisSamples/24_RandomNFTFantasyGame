## Instructions
- For playing with the contract without creating the dApp
    - Paste the content of contract_reference/guess_number.sol in remix https://remix.ethereum.org/
    - Compile it
    - Use injected web3 as the environment and connect your metamask in the mumbai testnet.
    - Instead of deploying the contract choose At Address and input 0x13e6603C07B9DD5BcB93f12A16c8d0222358546c
    - Click At Address
    - Under deployed contracts you will see the deployed contract

- You will need a testing server to run the code. There are several options in the video we used the one that comes by default with Python3
    - Install python3
    - run python3 python3 -m http.server
    - the server will be active at: python3 -m http.server

- Happy Building!
